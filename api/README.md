## Blog REST API
This is a blog REST API built using Node.js and the JS-framework Express. There are public routes where anyone can access published blog posts, as well as private routes where only admins can access unpublished posts, as well as create, update and delete.

# Features
- User signup (user and publisher)
- CRUD operations on blog posts
- Public access to published posts
- Advanced search filters based on category, date etc.
- Convenient and safe authentication using cookies
- Safety measures by using rate limits, preventing HTTP parameter pollution, NoSQL injections and XSS

Feel free to fork this repo and raise an issue. All suggestions are welcome!
